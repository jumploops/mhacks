This is the repo from the "Building Apps with Generative AI" workshop at [MHacks F24](https://mhacks.org).

## Background

In this workshop we built a Hackathon Project UI generator... entirely with LLMs. 

Here are the chats/outputs: 
 
- [v0.dev for UI design](https://v0.dev/chat/FQh8H1W6yL7?b=b_bQl5j7J5weF)
- [Claude API Artifact](https://claude.site/artifacts/f96948f6-f9b5-480f-9680-87451d380cde)
- [Claude UI Artifact](https://claude.site/artifacts/059eb699-2436-42d3-853d-6eb5f0787093)

Unfortunately there's not a built-in way to share the chat history from Claude :(

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
